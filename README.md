### Raspberry Pi‚ÄìBased Cost-Effective Setup

The Raspberry Pi‚Äìbased system provides a **low-cost alternative** to industrial-grade spindle health monitoring, while maintaining accurate frequency detection for predictive maintenance.


#### üì¶ Hardware Components
- **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B** ‚Üí Data acquisition & processing

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle
1. **Vibration Sensing**  
   The IEPE accelerometer captures spindle vibration and sends an analog voltage signal to the signal conditioning circuit.  
   - LM317 supplies constant current to the IEPE sensor.  
   - AC coupling removes DC bias.  
   - TL072 op-amp buffers and conditions the signal for ADC conversion.

2. **Data Acquisition**  
   The MCP3208 ADC samples the conditioned vibration signal and sends digital data to the Raspberry Pi over SPI.

3. **Data Processing**  
   A Python script on the Pi:
   - Performs **real-time logging** to CSV.
   - Computes **FFT** to extract dominant vibration frequencies.
   - Triggers data capture automatically at specific spindle speeds.

4. **Automated Triggering via Arduino + DAC**  
   - The Raspberry Pi sends the **desired spindle frequency** to the Arduino.  
   - The Arduino calculates the corresponding **control voltage** needed by the spindle drive.  
   - This value is sent to the MCP4725 DAC, which outputs an analog voltage.  
   - An op-amp amplifies the DAC output to match the spindle control input requirements.  
   - This mechanism ensures **automated spindle speed setting**, eliminating manual adjustments.

**Frequency Spectrum Example**  
![Frequency Spectrum](results/Frequency-Spectrum.png)

#### üìà Acceleration Response & Frequency Spectrum at Multiple Speeds

The spindle health monitoring system was tested at **three operating speeds** corresponding to vibration frequencies of **200 Hz**, **300 Hz**, and **400 Hz**.

##### ‚è± Time-Series Acceleration Plot
- Displays the measured acceleration over time for each operating speed.
- Waveforms show **clear periodic patterns** whose frequency increases proportionally with spindle speed.
- **Stable amplitude envelopes** indicate consistent running conditions without sudden transients.

##### üìä Frequency Spectrum Plot (FFT)
- For each speed, the FFT reveals a **dominant peak at twice the rotational frequency** (*second harmonic*), a characteristic indicator of **axial misalignment**.
- **Secondary peaks** and harmonic content suggest the possibility of **combined faults** such as looseness or coupling issues.


### ‚öñÔ∏è Benchmarking High Precision LabVIEW setup with Compact & Cost-effective setup

**The benchmarking test using a 159 Hz Calibrometer** demonstrated that both the CompactRIO + LabVIEW system and the Raspberry Pi cost-effective setup captured the dominant vibration frequency with remarkable consistency.
In both cases, the frequency spectrum exhibited a clear, sharp peak at 159 Hz, validating the accuracy of the low-cost solution in frequency-domain analysis.

While the CompactRIO system delivered lower noise levels, higher sampling rates, and multi-channel capability, the Raspberry Pi implementation provided comparable frequency detection performance at a fraction of the cost.
These results confirm that the Raspberry Pi‚Äìbased system is a reliable alternative for applications where budget and portability are key considerations, without sacrificing core diagnostic accuracy.

The experimental results from both the CompactRIO + LabVIEW setup and the Raspberry Pi cost-effective system show a high degree of agreement in detecting dominant vibration frequencies. The frequency spectrum peaks are consistent across both platforms, confirming that the low-cost setup can achieve accurate frequency detection comparable to the industrial-grade system.
